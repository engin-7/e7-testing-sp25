    "While a program is running, its data is stored in random access memory (RAM). RAM is fast, but it is also volatile, meaning data disappear when the program ends or the computer shuts down. To preserve data for future use, share it with collaborators, or interact with external resources, we have to store it as a **file**. A file is a structured block of data stored within the file system of the computer's operating system. For instance, this lecture notebook itself is a file. In this section, we will learn how to use Python to read and write data in several common file formats.\n",

    "A **text** file, often with a **.txt** extension, is a file containing plain text without any special formatting like bold text, fonts, or font sizes. Despite their simplicity, text files serve as the foundation for storing and sharing information in a wide range of applications.

    "## 3.1. Opening and Closing Files\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with TXT and CSV files in Python, it's crucial to open and close files properly to ensure data integrity and avoid resource leaks. There are two primary methods to open files: using the `with` statement and using the `open()` function directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In all of the previous examples, we opened files using the following syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open(filename, mode) as f:\n",
    "    # perform any operations\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the preferred method to open files in Python, as it ensures that the file is automatically closed once all operations within the block are completed, even if an error occurs during file processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, files can be opened using the `open()` function directly (without using `with`). However, this method requires explicitly closing the file using the `close()` method. Closing the file is essential to ensure that all resources are released and any written data is saved.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "f = open(filename, mode)\n",
    "# perform any operations\n",
    "f.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the `with` statement to open files is the preferred method in Python as it ensures the file is automatically closed once operations are completed, reducing the risk of resource leaks and potential data loss. The alternative approach of using the `open()` function directly requires explicit file closure, which can introduce bugs if not handled properly. For clean, readable, and reliable file handling, always use the `with` statement.\n",

    "## 3.2. CSV Files Using Pandas Package\n",
    "\n",
    "While NumPy is convenient for handling CSV files containing only numeric data, another powerful tool for working with CSV files, especially those with mixed data types, is the Pandas package. Pandas is a widely used data science library in Python for data manipulation and analysis. To use Pandas, we need to import it first, typically using the alias `pd`: `import pandas as pd`.\n",

    "## 3.3. Pickle Files\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have discussed how to store data using text and csv files. In some cases, we want to store data while preserving their data type (tuples, lists, dictionaries, etc.) to use them later or send them to colleagues. In thick case, we can use **pickle** files, which serialize objects so that they can be saved into a file and loaded again later. Pickle files usually have **.pickle** or **.pkl** extension, and they are specific to Python.\n",

Unlike pickle, which is Python dependent, JSON is a language-independent data format, which makes it attractive to use. Besides, it usually takes less space on the disk and the manipulation is faster than pickle. Therefore, it is a good option to store your data using JSON.
