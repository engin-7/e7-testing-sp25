    "## Question 2: Streak Seeker â€“ Finding the Longest Run\n",
    "\n",
    "A consecutive run is a list of adjacent, consecutive integers. This list can be either increasing or decreasing. For example, `[5, 6, 7, 8, 9]` is a consecutive run of length 5, `[5, 4, 3]` is a consecutive run of length 3, whereas `[3, 5, 7, 10, 15]` is not a consecutive run. If we consider the list `[3, 4, 5, 7, 14, 15]`, it has two consecutive runs: `[3, 4, 5]` and `[14, 15]`, where `[3, 4, 5]` is the longest consecutive run with length 3.\n",
