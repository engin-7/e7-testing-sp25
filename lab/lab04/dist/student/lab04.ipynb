    "A *k-bonacci sequence* is a generalization of the Fibonacci sequence. In a k-bonacci sequence, each term is the sum of the k preceding terms. The Fibonacci sequence is a special case with k = 2, where each term is the sum of the two previous terms. In a 3-bonacci sequence (k = 3), each term is the sum of the three previous terms, and so on. A k-bonacci sequence starts with k $-$ 1 zeros and then a one. Each subsequent element is the sum of the previous k elements. For example:\n",
